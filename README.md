#1	Introduction

Research on heart diseases has always been the centre of attention of the World Health Organisation(WHO, 2021). More than 17.9 million people died from it in 2016, which represents 31% of the overall deaths globally (WHO, 2021). It is predicted that Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) might be the leading cause of death in the future. Preventative measures should be taken into context to prevent increased mortality from CVD. Accurate diagnosis of CVD is essential to prevent further damage to the patient and could be implemented to find the factors and causation. 
Recently, the current medical environment has been widely utilising machine learning in medical diagnosis. In a CVD diagnosis problem, a set of features representative of all the variations of the disease is necessary. The objective of this study is to make a deeper analysis and prediction by using the OneR algorithm to diagnose the disease.
